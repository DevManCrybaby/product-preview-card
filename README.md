## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I was able to recognize some weak points on my basics capacities in the technologies of HTML and CSS.
I've a difficult using the correct semantics to structure the HTML file. I used majority the tag div.
And found some lacks about the properties from CSS, like in the case where I had to set the individual border-radius in the class:
```css 
.card .preview-product{
    border-top-left-radius: 10px;
    border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;
} 
```

Plus I gained a lot more experience building and refactoring a web page, beyond being able to get used to building responsivity.

### Continued development

I plan to keep progreeding in the technologies of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React right next it, just focusing in front end for now.
